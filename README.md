# Installing tesseract

`$ sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

$ sudo apt install libtesseract-dev`

You can find installing tutorial under the following url: https://medium.com/quantrium-tech/installing-tesseract-4-on-ubuntu-18-04-b6fcd0cbd78f

Then, change the tesseract_cmd path in your code. Under Ubuntu, it should be:

`pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/bin/tesseract' # config line`

And it's done! Now you can try it on your own images!
